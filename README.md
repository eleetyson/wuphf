Theranos. Nikola. WUPHF. Recent history is littered with the unfulfilled visions of charismatic, though equally dishonest, entrepreneurs.

While I can't (yet) bring Ryan Howard's brainchild to life, I've created a simplified version of WUPHF to help with distant socializing. Fire off emails and text messages simultaneously from a single dashboard.

You can start annoying your friends at <https://trywuphf.herokuapp.com> and watch a short demo [here](https://www.loom.com/share/759910bec8554d188d19a0c7bafe9862).

WUPHF is built with Rails, Postgres, and HTML / CSS. It uses Rails' Action Mailer to send emails and [Twilio's API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/ruby) for SMS messaging. I created the GIF above with [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) and recorded the demo with [Loom](https://www.loom.com/). All illustrations from [Pablo Stanley](https://www.opendoodles.com/), quotes from The Office, and typos from me. Concept inspired by [this fictional startup](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/WUPHF.com_(Website).

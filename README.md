### WUPHF
Theranos. Nikola. WUPHF. Recent history is littered with the unfulfilled visions of charismatic, though equally dishonest, entrepreneurs.

While I can't (yet) bring Ryan Howard's brainchild to life, I've created a simplified version of WUPHF to help with distant socializing. Fire off emails and text messages simultaneously from a single dashboard.

WUPHF is built with Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. It uses Rails' Action Mailer to send emails and [Twilio's API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/ruby) for SMS messaging. All illustrations from [Pablo Stanley](https://www.opendoodles.com/), quotes from The Office, and typos from me.
